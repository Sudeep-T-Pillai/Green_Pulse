# Green Pulse App Instructions

-------------------------------------------UPDATE--------------------------------------------------------------

This project aims to develop a fully-fledged Android application based on an idea that wasn't shortlisted for a solution challenge. Despite the setback, I am determined to bring this idea to life.
As of now, data for training a model is not available. To address this, I plan to create a dataset starting in late June 2024. The dataset is expected to be completed around September 2024.Contributions and feedback are welcome. 
If you are interested in collaborating or have suggestions for improvement, please feel free to reach out.

------------------How to use-----------------------------------------

Download the zip file.
Extract the contents to a folder named "Green Pulse."
Open the "Green Pulse" folder in your preferred code editor (VS Code is recommended).
Run the "Pubspec.yaml" file.
Connect an Android device to your computer.
Run the "main.dart" file (without debugging).

-------------------Note--------------------------------------------------

As the app is in its initial stage, sign-in/up using Google is not yet activated.
Email authentication is currently enabled for login.
The data used in the graphs is static and will be replaced with dynamic data in the future.

The data we plan to implement is from : https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/carbon-footprint-travel-mode
